Navigating the University of Bahrain(UOB) campus is challenging for
students, particularly newcomers, due to complex layouts, fragmented information
sources, and a lack of real-time updates. Current methods for finding classrooms,
professor office hours, and campus facilities are inefficient, leading to confusion and
missed opportunities. Additionally, students struggle to stay informed about
workshops, events, and critical campus alerts, which hampers engagement and
academic success. Scope of the Project: This project aims to develop a UOB Campus
Real-Time Navigation and Events Platform that will: 1. Provide real-time campus
navigation to locate classrooms, buildings, and facilities. 2. Centralize access to class
schedules, professor office hours, and contact information. 3. Deliver instant
notifications for events, workshops, and campus alerts
